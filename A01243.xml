            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <head>The manner of the fireworkes ≈øhewed vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Thames vpon the Thur≈øday be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the wedding.</head>
               <p>TO begin the≈øe tryumphant ≈øports, his highnes, the Qu√©enes Maie≈øtie, Prince <hi>Charles,</hi> Prince <hi>Fredericke,</hi> with the Princes <hi>Elizabeth</hi> his royall bride, and the re≈øt of the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilitie of England, vpon Thur≈øday the eleuenth of Februarie in the euening, being placed in the galleries and windowes about his Highnes Court of white Hall, where in the ≈øight of thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øands of people, many artificiall conclu≈øions in Fireworkes were vpon the <hi>Thames</hi> performed, and that the plea≈øurable ≈øights on the water, might equall the ≈øumptuous ≈øhowes on the land, thus they proc√©eded.</p>
               <p>Fir≈øt, for a welcome to the beholders, a peale of ordinance like vnto a terrible thunder ratled in the ayer, and ≈ø√©emed as it were to ≈øhake the earth: Immediately vpon this, a Racket of Fire bur≈øt from the water, and mounted ≈øo high into the Element that it dazeled the beholders eyes to looke after it.</p>
               <p>Secondly, followed a number more of the ≈øame fa≈øhion, ≈øpred<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding ≈øo ≈øtrangely with ≈øparkling blazes, that the ≈økie ≈ø√©emed to be filled with fire, or that there had b√©ene a combate of darting ≈øtarres fighting in the ayre, and all the time the≈øe continued, cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine cannons planted in the fields adioyning made thundring mu≈øicke, to the great plea≈øure of the beholders.</p>
               <p>After this in a mo≈øt curious manner, an artificiall fireworke with great wonder was ≈ø√©ene flying in the ayre, like vnto a dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gon, again≈øt which an other fierie vi≈øion appeared flaming like to Saint <hi>George</hi> on Hor≈øebacke, brought in by aburning In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chanter, betw√©ene which was then fought a mo≈øt ≈øtrange battell continuing a quarter of an hower or more: the dragon being vanqui≈øhed, ≈ø√©emed to rore like thunder, and withall bur≈øt in p√©eces and ≈øo vani≈øhed, but the champion with his flaming hor≈øe for a litle time made a ≈øhew of a truimphant conque≈øt, and ≈øo cea≈øed.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:5897:3"/>After this, was heard an other ratling ≈øound of Cannons, almo≈øt couering the ayre with fire and ≈ømoake, and forthwith appeared out of a hill of earth made vpon the water, a very ≈øtrange fire flaming vpright like vnto a blazing ≈øtarre: After which flew forth a number of rackets ≈øo high in the ayre, that we could not chu≈øe but approue by all rea≈øons that Arte hath exc√©e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded Nature, ≈øo artificially were they performed, and ≈øtill as the Chambers and Culuerines plaide vpon the earth, the fireworkes danced in the ayre, to the great delight of his Highnes, and the other Princes.</p>
               <p>Out of the ≈øame mount or hill of earth flew an other ≈øtrange p√©ece of artificiall fire-worke, which was in the likenes of a hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Hart, running vpon the waters ≈øo ≈øwiftly, as it had bene chaced by many hunt≈ømen.</p>
               <p>After the ≈øame, i≈ø≈øued out of the mount, a number of hunting hounds made of fire burning, pur≈øuing the afore≈øaid Harte vp and downe the waters, making many rebounds and turnes with much ≈øtrangenes: ≈økipping in the ayre, as it had bene a v≈øuall hunting vpon land.</p>
               <p>The≈øe were the noble delights of Princes, and prompt were the wits of men to contriue ≈øuch Princely plea≈øures.</p>
               <p>Where Kings commands be, Art is ≈øtretcht to the true depth, as the performance of the≈øe Enginers haue here approued.</p>
               <p>But now again to our wi≈øhed ≈øports, when this fiery hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting extingui≈øhed, and that the Elements a little cleared from fire and ≈ømoake, there came ≈øayling vp, as it were vpon the Seas, certaine ≈øhippes and gallies brauely rigd with top and top gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lant, with their flagges and ≈øtreamers wauing like men of warre, which repre≈øented a Chri≈øtian Nauie oppo≈øed again≈øt the Turkes, where after they had a while houered, preparing as it were to make an incur≈øion into the Turki≈øh countrey, they were di≈øcouered by two Towers or Ca≈øtles of defence, ≈øtrongly furni≈øhed to intercept all ≈øuch inuading purpo≈øes, ≈øo ≈øending forth the reports of a cannon, they were brauely an≈øwered with the like from the gallies, banding fire and powder one from an other, as if the God of battels had b√©ene there pre≈øent.</p>
               <p>Here was the manner of a Sea Fight rightly performed:
<pb facs="tcp:5897:4"/>
Fir≈øt by a≈ø≈øayling one an other, all ≈øtriuing for victorie, and pur≈øuing each other with Fire and ≈øword, the Caluerines merily plaid betwixt them, and made the ayre re≈øound with thundring Ecchoes, and at la≈øt, to repre≈øent the ioyes of a victorie, the Ca≈øtles were ≈øacked, burned and ruinated, and the defenders of the ≈øame forced to e≈øcape with great danger.</p>
               <p>During the time of all the≈øe triumphant exerci≈øes, there was not a man vnbu≈øied, but euery one laboured, ≈øome on Land, ≈øome on Water, ≈øome one way, ≈øome an other, to moue his Highnes, and the re≈øt of his princely friends a plea≈øing content, which hee and the other Princes with a gratious acceptance, applau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, to the great comort of the performers, and no litle ioy to the beholders.</p>
               <p>The next morning, being Fryday, his Highnes, not inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to grace the following ≈øports with his pre≈øence, gaue cau≈øe of forbeara<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>ce, with ≈øome re≈øt to the Enginers for their great toyle the night before.</p>
               <p>Moreouer, it was thought conuenient that a whole dayes preparatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g> ≈øhould be made, in prouiding again≈øt the Saterdayes pa≈øtimes, which moued a more longing de≈øire in the harts of his ≈øubiects to ≈ø√©e the ≈øame, which at the time appointed was in this maner accomplied.</p>

               <p>There was a barre or a kind of artificiall fence made vpon the riuer of Thames with Barges and Lighters chained together, to k√©epe out pa≈ø≈øengers, which otherwi≈øe with much vnrulines would haue hindered the pa≈øtimes, and much troubled the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formers, but being thus hemde in, as it were vpon the maine Seas, the two Venetian ≈øhippes as I ≈øaid before, falling within danger of the Turki≈øh gallies, indured a fre≈øh encounter, and long time mo≈øt worthily defended them≈øelues, but by rea≈øon of the number of the gallies, they were at la≈øt boarded, taken, and carried as boote and prize vnder the commaund of a Turki≈øh Ca≈øtle, which repre≈øented and bare the name of the ca≈øtle of <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geir,</hi> Furni≈øhed with 22. well approued great p√©eces of Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, which was contriued and built vpon <hi>Lambeth</hi> ≈øide, at a place named <hi>Stand-gate,</hi> inuironed with craggie Rocks as the ≈øaid Ca≈øtle is now ≈øcituate in Turkie.</p>
               <p>After the Gallies had taken the≈øe Venetian ≈øhips, and deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red them into the Turki≈øh Admiralls commaund, they had ≈øight of an other Argo≈øay or Galliaza, which ≈ø√©emed to be of <hi>Spaine,</hi> which likewi≈øe after a fierce conflict they made prize of, and with much tryumph rendred the ≈øame vp al≈øo to the Turki≈øh Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall.</p>
               <p>After this, vpon a ≈øuddaine there was a thundring peale of Ordinance or Chambers placed in <hi>Lambeth Mar≈øhe,</hi> wherevpon the Scoutes and Watches of the Ca≈øtle, di≈øcouered an Engli≈øh

               <p>Neare vnto this place ≈øtood a high built watch Tower, or Beacon of the Turkes, which at the fir≈øt ≈øight of the Engli≈øh Nauie was ≈øet on fire, as the manner is at all ≈øuch incur≈øions, which blazing Light (as it ≈ø√©emed) gaue notice to the Ca≈øtle, and cau≈øed a readines in the ≈øame for defence: In the meane time, the Kings Pinnaces and the Turki≈øh Gallies ioynde, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt whom, were ≈øhowne many ≈øtrange attempts, euen as they had ventured their very liues for their countries ≈øafeties: they ≈øpared neither powder nor pollicie, to ≈øacke one an other, but on both ≈øides be≈øtird them≈øelues ≈øo brauely, that his High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈ø≈øe withall the re≈øt of his attendants were therewith much delighted: At la≈øt the Gallies being ouercharged with long and forward incounters of the Engli≈øh Nauie, for refuge and ≈øhelter made new vnto the Ca≈øtle, which began likewi≈øe to play brauely vpon the Engli≈øh, and with their thundering ordinance made as it were the ground to ≈øhake.</p>
               <p>The Kings Nauie to an≈øwere them was not backward in a performance, but made the ayre gloomie with fire and ≈ømoake rorering from their lowde mouthed Cannons.</p>
               <p>The fight for a time continued fiercely, the victorie leaning to neither ≈øide, either of them attempting to a≈ø≈øault and board each other, but at la≈øt the Gallies being ≈øore bruzed and beaten, began to y√©eld, wherevpon the Engli≈øh Admirall fell downe and ca≈øt anker before the Ca≈øtle, and then ≈øpared not in the be≈øt man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner to thunder off their Ordinance, whereat the Turkes y√©el<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded both Ca≈øtle and Gallies, and ≈øubmitted to the conque≈øt of the Engli≈øh Admirall, who fiered many of the ≈øaid Gallies, ≈øacked the Ca≈øtle, and tooke pri≈øoner the Turki≈øh Admirall, with diuers Ba≈øhawes and other great Turkes, and al≈øo recouered the <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netian</hi> and <hi>Spani≈øh</hi> Shippes, before taken by the Gallies.
